iTunesLibraryPreener
====================

A tool for scanning your iTunes library and doing handy things. It originated as a tool to find all songs without cover-art or with multiple cover-arts or with cover-art lower than a certain resolution. Later, I made it so that it could auto-name series of videos I dropped into iTunes. It uses JACOB and/or COM4J. I haven't decided which I like, yet.
